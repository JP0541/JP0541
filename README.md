GITHUB, FOR A FIRSTTIMER, IS AN ENIGMA, FURTHER WRAPPED IN LAYERS. THE INITIATERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OF SIMPLE THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GOALS
OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS.  STILL IGNORNING IT ALL, I WANT TO TAKE A LEAP INTO IT.  WHAT PERSUADES ME TO DO SO, IS TO DO SOME SYSTEMATIC 
LEARNING OF A SUBJECT WHICH HAS EXCITED ME.  AND THAT IS BUILDING SIMPLE PAGE WEBSITES WHICH ARE VERY FAST.

I HAVE TAKEN THIS LEARNING, AT A VERY ADVANCE AGE, BECAUSE DIFFICULT PROJECTS HAVE ATTRACTED ME ALWAYS.  APPARENTLY, THIS APEPARS TO BE
REASONABLE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING.

GIT HUB ITSELF IS COUCHED IN A LANGUAGE WHICH IS FOREIGN EVEN TO A LEARNED ONES.  PULL REQUEST. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

EVERY THING NEEDED TO BE BEGUN IN A SYSTEMATIC LINEAR DELOPMENT PROCESS, TO BE EASY TO PICKUP.  I AM LEAVING THESE INITIAL THOUGHTS 
AND TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE.  

USE OF COMMIT. AGAIN IT IS A DISCOVERY. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT COMMIT MEANS.  IS IT SAVING SOME THING. OR SEOMETHING ELSE.
